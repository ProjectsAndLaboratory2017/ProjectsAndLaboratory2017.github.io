            <p class="lead">Project developed for the course <a href="https://didattica.polito.it/pls/portal30/sviluppo.guide.visualizza?p_cod_ins=01POJOV&p_a_acc=2017&p_lang=EN">Projects and Laboratory on communication systems</a></p>

        <h3>Overview of the project</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="text-justify">To have a general idea about the project you can view <a href="/files/presentation.pdf">the slides of the presentation</a>.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The system is a prototype of a self-checkout cash register for a generic supermarket. The system enables users
                to identify themselves and scan the products they bought.</p>
            <h4>Client side (board)</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The client side is made with the <a href="https://www.ghielectronics.com/catalog/product/432">FEZ Spider II</a> connected to some peripherals. It is the device that allows user to interact with the system, scanning the codes and using the GUI on the touchscreen.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">For taking better pictures we made a "black box" around the camera, that internally contains some LED lights and has a small window on the top that can be used to expose the barcodes / QRcodes.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">The role of the client side is to send images to the server, display information on the screen and interact with the buyer, allowing the creation of receipts.</p>
            <h4>Server side</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The server receives images from the client and performs a lookup in the database, returning informations about the user and about the products.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">It has a basic GUI for logging and to see the pictures sent from the client.</p>
            <h4>Database</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The database is responsible for keeping persistence of the data: it contains the data about the products, the users, the receipts and has some other tables that allow reordering products from the warehouse when the shelves are nearly empty</p>
            <h4>Website</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">The website is a useful tool to let the user see their purchase history and the collected points, and allow the administrator to see purchases and to manage the inventory.</p>
